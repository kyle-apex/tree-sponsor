# Tree Sponsor Project Rules for Cline

This file provides guidance for Cline (Claude) when assisting with development on the TreeFolks Young Professionals project.

## Project Overview

- This is a Next.js application with TypeScript that powers https://tfyp.org
- Primary functionality includes:
  - Event Check-in Page
  - Tree Identification and Tree ID quizzes
  - Member management
  - Member referral pages
  - Custom forms/surveys
- Hidden/Deprecated Functionality:
  - Tree Sponsorship/Thank-a-Tree

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 12.x
- React 17.x
- TypeScript
- Prisma ORM with MySQL database
- Material UI (MUI) 5.x
- Jest for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

## Project Structure

- `/pages`: Next.js pages and API routes
- `/components`: React components organized by feature
- `/prisma`: Database schema and migrations
- `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/test`: Test files

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

1. Follow TypeScript best practices:

   - Use proper typing for all variables, parameters, and return values
   - Avoid using `any` type when possible
   - Use interfaces for object shapes
   - Use type guards when necessary

2. React Component Guidelines:

   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks in `/utils/hooks`
   - Use proper prop typing with TypeScript interfaces

3. State Management:

   - Use React Query for server state
   - Use React Context for global UI state when necessary
   - Prefer local component state when possible

4. Styling:
   - Use MUI components and styling system
   - Follow the project's theme configuration in `/utils/theme.ts`
   - Use emotion for custom styling when needed

### Database Operations

1. Always use Prisma client for database operations
2. Follow the schema defined in `/prisma/schema.prisma`
3. When creating migrations:
   - Use `npx prisma migrate dev --name migration-name`
   - Keep migrations focused on specific changes
   - Document complex migrations

### API Development

1. Place API routes in `/pages/api`
2. Follow RESTful principles
3. Implement proper error handling and status codes
4. Use TypeScript interfaces for request and response types

### Testing

1. Write tests for new functionality
2. Use Jest and React Testing Library
3. Focus on testing user behavior rather than implementation details
4. Mock external dependencies appropriately
5. Do not correct TypeScript errors until the task is complete and ready for commit
   - Allow type errors to exist while initially writing tests that may fail by design
   - Only fix type errors when the implementation is complete and tests are passing
6. Never mock the component being tested
   - Mock dependencies and external services, not the component under test
   - Test the actual component implementation, not a mock version

### Git Workflow

1. For each new task or feature:

   - Create a feature branch from main: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
   - Use a naming convention like `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`, or `refactor/` prefix

2. Commit changes with meaningful messages:

   - Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Be descriptive but concise
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable: "Add user profile page (#123)"

3. Before creating a PR:

   - Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
   - Run linting: `npm run lint`
   - Verify the feature works as expected

4. Create a Pull Request:

   - Provide a clear title and description
   - Reference any related issues
   - Add appropriate reviewers
   - Include screenshots for UI changes if applicable

5. After PR approval:
   - Merge to main branch using `gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --merge --admin --delete-branch` to bypass branch protection rules
   - Do not attempt to approve your own PRs (use `gh pr merge` directly without `gh pr review`)
   - The feature branch will be automatically deleted when using the `--delete-branch` flag

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name`
2. Plan the feature and identify affected components
3. Update database schema if necessary
4. Create or modify API endpoints
5. Implement UI components
6. Add tests
7. Update documentation
8. Commit changes with meaningful messages
9. Create a pull request for review and merge

### Fixing Bugs

1. Create a bugfix branch: `git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description`
2. Reproduce the issue
3. Write a test that fails due to the bug
4. Fix the implementation
5. Verify the test passes
6. Document the fix
7. Commit changes with meaningful messages
8. Create a pull request for review and merge

### Database Schema Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/db-schema-change-description`
2. Modify `/prisma/schema.prisma`
3. Generate a migration with `npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive-name`
4. Update affected API routes and components
5. Test the changes thoroughly
6. Commit changes with meaningful messages
7. Create a pull request for review and merge

## Deployment

- The application is deployed to production at https://tfyp.org
- Node.js 14.x is required for deployment
- Heroku is used for hosting

## Local Development Setup

1. Install MySQL
2. Create a database named `treefolksyp`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npx prisma generate`
5. Run `npx prisma migrate deploy`
6. Start the development server with `npm run server`

## Important Notes

- The codebase uses Node.js 14.x
- Some features like Tree Sponsorship are deprecated but still in the codebase
- The project follows ESLint and Prettier configurations defined in the root files
