# Project Progress

## Current Status

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, we're establishing a baseline understanding of the project. The current status is being inferred from the codebase structure and open files.

## What Works

Based on the project structure, the following features appear to be implemented:

1. **Core Application Framework**:

   - Next.js application setup
   - Page routing
   - Component structure

2. **User Management**:

   - Authentication (login/signup)
   - User profiles
   - Account management

3. **Tree Functionality**:

   - Tree display components
   - Tree identification flow
   - Tree mapping

4. **Event System**:

   - Event check-in functionality
   - Calendar views
   - Welcome page with applause sound for supporting members
   - Confetti animation for supporting members

5. **Development Environment**:
   - Docker container setup
   - Database configuration
   - Browser automation support

## In Progress

Based on open files and project structure, these areas appear to be in active development:

1. **DevContainer Configuration**:

   - Docker compose setup
   - Container rebuild process
   - Browser integration for testing and automation

2. **Database Initialization**:

   - Demo data setup
   - Database schema refinement

3. **Testing**:

   - Component tests for check-in functionality
   - Page tests

4. **Tree Identification**:
   - Tree display dialog
   - Identification flow

## What's Left to Build

Without specific requirements documentation, potential areas for future development might include:

1. **Feature Enhancements**:

   - Advanced search capabilities
   - Reporting and analytics
   - Enhanced user interactions

2. **Performance Optimizations**:

   - Image loading and processing
   - Map rendering efficiency

3. **Testing Coverage**:

   - Expanding test coverage
   - End-to-end testing

4. **Documentation**:
   - User guides
   - API documentation
   - Developer onboarding

## Known Issues

Current known issues include:

1. **Development Environment**:

   - Container setup and permissions
   - Database initialization
   - ✅ Fixed: Cline Recent Tasks history lost after dev container rebuilds (solution: added persistent volume for VSCode extensions data)

2. **Testing**:

   - Mocking components for testing
   - Test coverage gaps

3. **Feature Implementation**:
   - Edge cases in tree identification
   - Check-in process reliability

## Recent Fixes

1. **Development Environment**:

   - ✅ Fixed: Cline Recent Tasks history persistence across container rebuilds
   - Permanently modified docker-compose.yml to include a vscode-server volume
   - Permanently updated rebuild-devcontainer.sh to preserve the vscode-server volume during rebuilds
   - ✅ Added: read-memory-bank.sh script for improved memory bank reading performance
   - ✅ Fixed: VSCode formatter configuration issue by setting Prettier as the default formatter
   - ✅ Added: GitHub CLI authentication persistence across container rebuilds
   - Permanently modified docker-compose.yml to include a github-cli-config volume
   - Permanently updated rebuild-devcontainer.sh to preserve the github-cli-config volume during rebuilds

2. **Event System**:
   - ✅ Added: Applause sound effect for supporting members when they check in
   - The sound plays for 10 seconds while the welcome message displays for 15 seconds
   - Sound only plays for users identified as supporting members
