# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

This application appears to follow a modern web application architecture with:

1. **Next.js Framework**: Server-side rendering and API routes
2. **React Component Structure**: Modular UI components
3. **Prisma ORM**: Database access layer
4. **Authentication System**: User management and access control
5. **External Integrations**: Maps, payment processing, etc.

## Component Organization

Based on the file structure, the application organizes components by feature/domain:

```
components/
├── account/       # User account management
├── admin/         # Administrative functions
├── event/         # Event-related components
├── maps/          # Mapping functionality
├── tree/          # Tree-related components
├── form/          # Form components
├── layout/        # Layout components
├── notification/  # Notification components
└── shared/        # Shared/common components
```

## Page Structure

The application follows Next.js page-based routing:

```
pages/
├── _app.tsx       # Application wrapper
├── _document.tsx  # Document structure
├── index.tsx      # Home page
├── login.tsx      # Authentication
├── map.tsx        # Map view
├── account/       # User account pages
├── admin/         # Admin pages
├── api/           # API routes
└── [dynamic]/     # Dynamic routes
```

## Data Flow Patterns

1. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Initial page loads with data
2. **Client-Side Fetching**: Dynamic data updates
3. **API Routes**: Backend functionality exposed through Next.js API routes
4. **Database Access**: Prisma ORM for database operations

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Component Composition**: Building complex UIs from smaller components
2. **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation of data and presentation logic
3. **Context API**: For state management across components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulating reusable logic
5. **Server-Side Props**: Data fetching for SSR

## Authentication Flow

The application appears to implement authentication with:

- Login/signup pages
- Session management
- Protected routes
- User roles and permissions

## Integration Patterns

1. **Maps Integration**: Google Maps and/or Mapbox for location services
2. **Payment Processing**: Likely Stripe for handling payments
3. **Image Storage**: Handling uploads and storage of images
4. **External APIs**: Integration with third-party services
