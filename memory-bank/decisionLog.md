2025-03-22 03:44:00 - Added applause sound effect for supporting members on check-in

## Decision

Added an applause sound effect that plays for 10 seconds when a supporting member checks in to an event.

## Rationale

- Enhance the user experience for supporting members
- Provide audible feedback to acknowledge and appreciate financial supporters
- Create a more engaging and interactive check-in experience
- Complement the existing visual confetti effect with an audio component

## Implementation Details

- Added an HTML audio element with a reference to an applause.mp3 file
- Modified the showNextWelcome function to only play the sound for users with isSupporter flag
- Set up a separate timeout to stop the sound after exactly 10 seconds
- Kept the welcome message display for 15 seconds (longer than the sound)
- Used the existing isSupporter state which is already being set based on the user's subscription status
