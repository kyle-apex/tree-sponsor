# Active Context

## Current Focus

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, we're establishing baseline documentation for the project. The current focus appears to be on understanding the project structure and functionality based on the available codebase.

## Recent Activities

- Created memory bank documentation
- Analyzed project structure and components
- Identified key technologies and patterns

## Active Development Areas

Based on the open tabs in the editor, current development may be focused on:

1. **DevContainer Setup**: Configuration of the development environment

   - Docker compose configuration
   - Dockerfile settings
   - Container rebuild script

2. **Database Initialization**:

   - Database setup scripts
   - Demo data initialization

3. **Testing**:

   - Check-in functionality tests
   - Component testing

4. **Tree and Event Components**:
   - Tree display and identification components
   - Event check-in functionality

## Current Challenges

Without specific task history, potential challenges might include:

1. **Development Environment**: Ensuring consistent setup across developers
2. **Testing Coverage**: Implementing comprehensive tests for components
3. **Feature Completion**: Finalizing core functionality for trees and events

## Next Steps

Potential next steps based on the current state:

1. **Environment Setup**: Finalize development container configuration
2. **Testing**: Complete test coverage for critical components
3. **Feature Development**: Continue work on tree identification and event check-in
