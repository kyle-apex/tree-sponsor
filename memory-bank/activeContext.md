# Active Context

## Current Focus

As this is the initial setup of the memory bank, we're establishing baseline documentation for the project. The current focus appears to be on understanding the project structure and functionality based on the available codebase.

## Recent Activities

- Created memory bank documentation
- Analyzed project structure and components
- Identified key technologies and patterns
- Added browser support to the dev container for browser automation capabilities
- Fixed issue with Cline Recent Tasks history persistence after dev container rebuilds

## Active Development Areas

Based on the open tabs in the editor, current development may be focused on:

1. **DevContainer Setup**: Configuration of the development environment

   - Docker compose configuration
   - Dockerfile settings with browser support
   - Container rebuild script
   - Browser automation capabilities

2. **Database Initialization**:

   - Database setup scripts
   - Demo data initialization

3. **Testing**:

   - Check-in functionality tests
   - Component testing

4. **Tree and Event Components**:
   - Tree display and identification components
   - Event check-in functionality

## Current Challenges

Current challenges include:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Ensuring consistent setup across developers
   - Maintaining persistence of development tools state across container rebuilds
   - Fixed issue with Cline Recent Tasks history being lost after container rebuilds
2. **Testing Coverage**: Implementing comprehensive tests for components
3. **Feature Completion**: Finalizing core functionality for trees and events

## Next Steps

Potential next steps based on the current state:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Finalize development container configuration
   - Consider other development tools that may need persistence volumes
   - ✅ Completed: Fixed Cline data persistence across container rebuilds
   - ✅ Completed: Added read-memory-bank.sh script for improved memory bank reading
2. **Testing**: Complete test coverage for critical components
3. **Feature Development**: Continue work on tree identification and event check-in
4. **Documentation**: Enhance code documentation and user guides

## Active Decisions

Key decisions that may be under consideration:

1. **Database Schema**: Finalizing data models and relationships
2. **UI/UX Improvements**: Enhancing user interface components
3. **Testing Strategy**: Approach for ensuring code quality and reliability
